# RouteMaster: Optimal Path Visualization

RouteMaster is a web-based visualization tool that helps you find the optimal path through a network using Dijkstra's algorithm. It also features Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) for different search orderings.

## Features

- Visualize graphs with weighted edges.
- Calculate optimal paths using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Explore graph traversal with BFS and DFS.
- Input graph data in JSON format.
- Interactive UI to select the starting node and traversal order.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start using the application.

## Usage

1. Input or paste your graph data in the JSON format provided.
2. Choose a starting node from the dropdown.
3. Select the desired search order.
4. Click `Calculate!` to view the results.

The visualization and solutions will be displayed on the screen.
